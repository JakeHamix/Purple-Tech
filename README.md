 ## 🔮 Startup
- `npm run init`
  - Install modules, set up docker and prepare database schema
- `npm run build`
  - Prepare backend and frontend bundles for production serving (and docs!) 🛠️
- `npm run start`
  - Start the whole application 🚀

##  🧪 Tests
- There are mostly just placeholder tests, but the project is ready for them, based on [ts-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-jest) 

## 📚  Documentation
- The available REST API is well documented using [apidoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apidoc). You can display the documentation by opening its [page](server/docs/index.html) (it is generated as a part of the build process!)
